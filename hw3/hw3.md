### SAMBA INSTRUCTION

Install a containerized samba server on your Ubuntu machine. This should be configured to share a directory on your Ubuntu machine via a mapped volume in your container. This directory should be accessible from your host machine. 
Follow instructions here:https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ubuntu-samba
Dont do the following.  

<!-- . Do the following: 
```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo apt install docker.io
    sudo apt install docker-compose
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
```
The code above will update and upgrade the system, install docker.io, if necesary and enable docker.

Then you need a .yml file: docker-compose.yml. It defines the services and maps the specified volume to/into the docker container.  The following should be in it
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  samba:
    image: dperson/samba
    container_name: samba-container
    restart: always
    networks:
      - samba-net
    ports:
      - "139:139"
      - "445:445"
    environment:
      - USER=myuser;mypassword
    volumes:
      - /path/to/shared/directory:/mnt/share
    command: "-w MYGROUP -s 'My Shared Folder:/mnt/share:rw:myuser'"

networks:
  samba-net:

```
dperson/samba is the samba repo.
Change <samba-container> to a name for the container you are comfortable with.
Here:```environment:
      - USER=myuser;mypassword```
  we are going to make a really  slapdash attempt at security.  Probably wouldnt be great for production, but here it is.  We are going to use openssl to encrypt the password:  ``` bash 
  echo "USER=user1;password123" | openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -out ~/docksecret.txt.encv ```

Make a directory in HOME: mkdir Shared_Samba (chooose a name you like and configure the yml file with the right path)

Make sure the file above is in a 'docker-compose.yml' file.  
Run it with 'sudo docker-compose up -d".  Make sure you run it with sudo priveliges or youll get a boatload of errors, that look like this:
```bash
  docker-compose up -d

RUN WITH SUDO!

Run 'sudo docker ps' to see the running container.  You should see some output like this: 
jelly@pbj:~$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND                          CREATED                STATUS   PORTS     NAMES
29ca70cc3ef8   dperson/samba   "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   About a minute ago   Restarting (1) 6 seconds ago             samba-container

docker ps also gets you the name of the container and its id. Now you can run:
```bash

```

Well, the 'dperson/samba' repo had some unresolvable errors.  It was probably user error. There are a lot of instructions -->

After careful googling and reading of samba documentation, I discovered that a) I put the 'shared' folder in the home directory, not the root directory, and b) i didn't change the .yml file appropriately. 
Here are the actual steps i did.  
1. Install docker: ```sudo apt install docker.io```  It was already installed, so good to go.
2. Pull the docker image: ``` sudo docker pull dperson/samba```
3. Make sure my 'shared' folder was in the root directory.
4. Run the following commandd:```sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -v /shared:/mount -d dperson/samba -s "shared;/mount;yes;no;yes;all;all" -u "user;password```
   (it adds a user:password, not great but there it is)
5.  It didn't work at first and then i allowed the samba traffic by adding a rule to pf.conf
  ```rdr pass on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port 139 -> 172.0.1.16 port 139
    rdr pass on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port 445 ->  172.0.1.16 port 445
  ```

I also installed docker on my laptop. 
And now i can use the file explorer to open up '\\172.0.1.16\'shared'.  If i add a file, it shows up!

## PIHOLE

Download a pihole image: ```sudo docker pull pihole/pihole```
So by default, port 53 is listening for something.   After messing around for a long time, i finally read some pi hole documentation, and found out if i added "DNSStubListener=no" to  /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, i could make it work.

I ran this ```sudo docker run -d --name pihole -e -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp -p 67:67/udp -p 80:80 -p 443:443 TZ="America/Los_Angeles" -v "$(pwd)/etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/" -v "$(pwd)/etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/"--network=pihole_network --hostname pi.hole -e VIRTUAL_HOST="pi.hole" ServerIP="192.168.33.1" -e WEBPASSWORD="user" PROXY_LOCATION="pi.hole"--restart=unless-stopped pihole/pihole:latest
```    Its kind of a mish-mash of garbage and I threw it at the wall, and some of it stuck.  So it kinda works

### Docker Compose

Docker-compose was installed allready during the initial installation. If its not run 'sudo apt install docker-compose'.  I ran this yml file:
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  samba:
    image: dperson/samba
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
        - "53:53/tcp"
        - "53:53/udp"
        - "67:67/udp"
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - /shared:/mount
    command: '-s "shared;/mount;yes;no;yes;all;all" 
      

  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Los_Angeles'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'user'
    volumes:
      - ./etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/
      - ./etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/
    ports:
      - 53:53/tcp
      - 53:53/udp
      - 67:67/udp
      - 80:80
      - 443:443

```
